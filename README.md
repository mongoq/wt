# wt
Run Linux commands per SSH without complicated login procedures.

Use wt (change wt command name to a short name that fits your server i.e. **brutus** -> **bt**).

To run commands on a server:

**wt ping pong.de**
**wt htop**
**wt shutodwn -h now**

Before you can do that you have to setup your server to password-less SSH-Login.
