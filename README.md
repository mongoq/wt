# wt
Run Linux commands per SSH without complicated login procedures.

Use wt (change wt command name to a short name that fits your server i.e. **brutus** -> **bt**).

Example commands to run on your server:

**wt ping pong.de**

**wt htop**

**wt shutdown -h now**

Before you can do that you have to setup your server to passwordless SSH-login.
